# The Role of Algorithms in Computing

Algorithm Design Technique:

- Strategy or paradigm: General approach to solve program algorithmically 
- Brute Force: Straight forward technique with na√Øve approach 
- Divide and conquer: problem is divided into smaller instances
- Decrease and conquer: Instance size is decreased to solve the problem 
- Transform and conquer: Instance is modified and then solved 
- Dynamic Programming: Results of smaller , reoccurring  instances are obtained to solve problem
- Greedy Technique: Solve the problem by making locally optimal decisions 

Analysis of Algorithm:
- Time Efficiency: Indicates how fasts algorithm runs
- Space Efficiency: How much extra memory the algorithm needs to complete its execution
- Simplicity: Generating sequence of instructions which are easy to understand 
- Generality: Range of inputs it can accept
