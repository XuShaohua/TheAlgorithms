Now, x = 5 and num = 5. \nIt can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 6.\n\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> num = 3, t = 2\n<strong>Output:</strong> 7\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The maximum achievable number is x = 7; after performing these operations, x will equal num: \n1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 6 and num = 4.\n2- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1.
