  "content": "<p>You are given a positive integer <code>arrivalTime</code> denoting the arrival time of a train in hours, and another positive integer <code>delayedTime</code> denoting the amount of delay in hours.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the time when the train will arrive at the station.</em></p>\n\n<p>Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5 \n<strong>Output:</strong> 20 \n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Arrival time of the train was 13:00 hours. It is delayed by 11 hours. Now it will reach at 13+11=24 (Which is denoted by 00:00 in 24 hours format so return 0).\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= arrivaltime &lt;&nbsp;24</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= delayedTime &lt;= 24</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
