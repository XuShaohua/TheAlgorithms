  "content": "<p>Given the array <code>nums</code>, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is <strong>strictly greater</strong> than the sum of the non&nbsp;included elements in such subsequence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with <strong>minimum size</strong> and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the <strong>maximum total sum</strong> of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>. Also return the answer sorted in <strong>non-increasing</strong> order.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,3,10,9,8]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [10,9] \n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included. However, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements.&nbsp;\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,4,7,6,7]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [7,7,6] \n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to be returned in non-increasing order.  \n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 500</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 100</code></li>\n</ul>\n",
